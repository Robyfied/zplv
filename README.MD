# ZPLV (Zile Pana la vacanta)
Translated to English "Days until break" is a dumb program I made that outputs a nice little message telling you how many days are left until the next break as well as 
how far into the school year you are (only works for the current day)

# DISCLAIMER
The schoolyear this currently works for is 2021 - 2022. I will likely update it yearly until 2023 - 2024 as that is when I will graduate from high school
