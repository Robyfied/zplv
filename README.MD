THIS REPO IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS

# ZPLV (Zile Pana la vacanta)
Translated to English "Days until break" is a dumb program I made that outputs a nice little message telling you how many days are left until the next break as well as how far into the school year you are (only works for the current day)

# RUNNING THE PROGRAM
1. Clone the repository
2. open console in root folder
3. install dependencies (**REQUIRES PIP**)
    ```terminal
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. run 
    ```terminal
    $ python main.py
    ```
# REQUIREMENTS
python (preferably 3.10.0 or later as this was the latest version when I wrote this)

# ADDITIONAL INFO
The schoolyear this currently works for is 2021 - 2022. I will likely update it yearly until 2023 - 2024 as that is when I will graduate from high school
